This Flutter app was made in response to the issue of misinformation within African countries regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Dubious, unscientfic, false, and dangerous information is spread on commonly used social media such as WhatsApp and Facebook, drowning out credible information from government and health bodies. I made this app in order to present credible information to the average person about the case numbers in any given African country, and also provide up-to date information about government and health body directives within the country. This information was provided in a manner that is easy to screenshot and share onto social media platforms, which is commonly how videos, photos and messages containing fake information is spread on such networks.
